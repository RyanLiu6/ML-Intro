# Fifth Class

1. Combine previous lessons together to produce a full application that:
* Receives manually taken images as input
* Produces a text file that represents Tesseractâ€™s understanding of what the Image contained
2. Build into real application - Shipping Label Recognizier
* Looks for similarity between given image and what we expect
* Decides if the image contains a shipping label that belongs to the home owner
