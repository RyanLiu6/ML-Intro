# Class 2
## Step 1 (15 Minutes)
Pull code from Class 3 Branch
Check homework progress and assign homework for next class

## Step 2 (45 Minutes)
Try running Tesseract on images Students take with their Phone. (Digital)
Have Students write words on a piece of paper and try Tesseract again. (Handwritten)

## Step 3 (60 Minutes)
Introduce idea of Pre-processing and understand the importance of cleaning Images

Complete exercises for:
* Turning images into Grayscale
* Transforming Grayscale into Binary using Threshold operations
* Clean up Images by denoising and applying transforms (FFT)

After the corresponding exercises, students should be able to answer:
1. How images are represented using the different data types
2. How to manipulate data and process images
3. Why these transformations work the way they do
4. Why we must pre-process images instead of just operating on taken images
