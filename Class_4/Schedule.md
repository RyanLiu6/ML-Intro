# Class 2
## Step 1 (15 Minutes)
Pull code from Class 4 Branch
Check homework progress and assign homework for next class

## Step 2 (30 Minutes)
Discuss concepts of Contrast and Brightness in regards to Image Quality
Ask Students what are the effects of Contrast + Brightness towards Images that we process

## Step 3 (35 Minutes)
Implement a simple Object that controls the Brightness and Contrast of any given image
Discuss about how and why this works (relating to understanding how images are represented in OpenCV)
Have students play around with images, controlling their Brightness and Contrast
Have students try Tesseract on the processed images and discuss the effect of Brightness and Contrast

## Step 4 (40 Minutes)
Implement a simple Object that converts Grayscale Images to Binary using moving threshold
Discuss effects of lighting on images (how humans see images and how computer sees images)
Have students play around with images, controlling the Lighting manually (from pictures they take)
Have students try Tesseract on the processed images and discuss the effect of Lighting
